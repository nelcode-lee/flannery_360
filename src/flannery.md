PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98)
Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether
exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The
scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide.
Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over
Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide
some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling
objects.
Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the
risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced.

RISK ASSESSMENTS AND METHOD STATEMENTS
Employers are required by law to protect your employees, and others, from
harm.
Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the
minimum you must do is:
• Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business
(hazards)
• Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how
seriously (the risk)
Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk.
The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to
document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY
perform a work-related task.
It is the plant operator’s responsibility to COMPLY with
the Method Statement.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES
In general plant operators are regarded as ‘safety-critical’ workers,
which means their actions with the machine can have significant
health & safety consequences for themselves and others.
It is essential that all personnel involved in the planning,
supervision and carrying out of mobile plant operations are
adequately trained and competent for their role.
If you are asked or told to
do something that you feel
or know is unsafe - or feel
that the safety of others is
being compromised - you
must report this to your site
supervisor.

MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A 360 EXCAVATOR
PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE
Power Unit –
Oils
Always wear gloves when checking engine oil to prevent skin disease and
contamination of oil onto the operating controls and the cab.
Hydraulic
System
Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is
released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when
filling the system to prevent contamination.
Fuel System Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent
condensation building up in the tank.
Cooling
Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow
System
hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns.
Roll Over
Protective
ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is
reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn.
Structure
Falling
Object
Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being
struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a
Protective
manufacturer’s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material
striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS
Structures
criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn.
Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is
Restraining
Systems
because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will
keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may
minimise injury.

ATTACH AND REMOVE BUCKETS USING QUICK HITCH
COUPLERS
There are many different types of excavating and grading buckets. The
choice of attachment will be determined by the operating application:
Digging, Trenching, Ditching, Grading, Trapezoidal, 360° Rotating.
It is now common to use a quick hitch coupler to connect an attachment
to the machine’s dipper arm.
Always ensure you have the relevant information and training prior to
using a bucket, attachment or quick hitch coupling system that you are unfamiliar with.
Excavator Piping
Excavator piping’s are an essential component of an excavator. They are used to transport
hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic cylinders and motors. The hydraulic
fluid is used to power the excavator’s boom, arm, and bucket. Excavator piping’s are also
used to power auxiliary hydraulic attachments such as hydraulic hammers, grapples, and
augers.
Learner Workbook 360 Excavator v2 Nov 2023 DRAFT
Page 25 of 47
There are many types of excavator piping’s available in the market. Some of the most
common types include:
1. 2. 3. 4. Standard piping: This type of piping is used for general-purpose applications and is
suitable for most excavators.
High-pressure piping: This type of piping is used for heavy-duty applications that
require high-pressure hydraulic fluid.
Low-pressure piping: This type of piping is used for light-duty applications that
require low-pressure hydraulic fluid.
Auxiliary piping: This type of piping is used to power auxiliary hydraulic attachments
such as hydraulic hammers, grapples, and augers.
If a tool requires pressurised oil, care must be taken when detaching the tool, particularly
when disconnected the oil feed and return lines. High pressure oil may be within the
hydraulic lines and must relieved and the engine turned off before the lines are
disconnected.
Always follow manufacturers guidance when depressurizing the relevant part of the hydraulic
system.
Pre-use checks of the Quick Hitch Coupling System
✓ Check for damage of the quick hitch coupler.
✓ Check for any cracks.
✓ Check the hydraulic lines for any damage or oil leaks.
✓ Ensure all pins and clips are in place and secure.
KNOWLEDGE STOP
1. Can you label each of the buckets below?
Learner Workbook 360 Excavator v2 Nov 2023 DRAFT
Page 26 of 47
Quick hitch couplers are used in the fitting and
removal process and fall into three
classifications:
• Manual Quick Hitch: there is not a hydraulic
system fitted. The operator must isolate all
controls and switch off the machine,
removing the key. The operator will manually
remove and insert the relevant pins, release
bar and clips.
• Semi-Automatic Quick Hitch: Whilst the
functions will be operated from the cab
through hydraulic rams, a locking pin must be
inserted into the correct hole manually. The
locking pin is used to prevent the latch or lock
from opening.
• Fully Automatic Quick Hitch: All functions
are carried out from the cab. Immediately
after coupling the attachment, the operator
must ensure that the hydraulic pressure is
applied to the coupler’s locking system.
For all types of quick hitch couplers, it is vital that the operator, immediately after
coupling the attachment, ensures that full hydraulic pressure is applied to the
coupler’s locking system.
For all types of quick hitch couplers, it is vital that the
operator, carries out a visual and physical inspection. This is
to ensure all pins are inserted correctly and are retained and
secure, or latches are fully engaged and locked. Always
ensure you isolate the machine, switch off the engine and
remove the key before exiting the cab to carry out this
inspection.

CONFIGURE AND SET-UP FOR LOADING DUTIES
✓ When loading vehicles, the operator should
ensure that the vehicle to be loaded is on
level ground, is secure and can take the
weight of the material to be loaded.
✓ To ensure efficiency the receiving vehicle
should be parked in a position that requires
minimal movement of the excavator.
✓ A level platform should be cut for the
machine to stand on whilst loading and the
correct size and type of bucket must be
used.
If loading a forward tipping dumper, the operator must
have dismounted the machine and moved to a safe
place before loading commences. This is to ensure that
the bucket of the machine or the load does not contact
the operator. Please refer to your site RAMS.

Underground Services
Again, it is important that work that involves excavating, or any type of ground
penetration is properly planned and managed to reduce the risk of accidents.
The Health and Safety Executive publication ‘Avoiding danger from
underground services (HSG47) gives valuable information and guidance on
how to safely plan and set up work near underground services.
There are various methods of identifying underground services including
desktop studies, site investigation and physical identification of services.
When services are located it is important to know what they are and what
danger they represent. A colour coding system is used to help identify the
type of service that may have been discovered:
• Red – Electricity
• Black – Electricity
• Orange – Street lighting
• Yellow – Gas
• Green – Communications
• Blue – Water
• Grey – Telecommunications / Water
In some instances, a service pipe, duct, or cable may be
laid with an additional coloured polythene marker tape
installed in the ground about 300 mm above it. The tape
is placed in this way so that it will be uncovered in the
event of future excavation and serve as a warning that a
service is located beneath it.
In some
circumstances
exclusion zones may
need to be set up and
permit to work
systems put in place.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXCAVATIONS
Topsoil excavation Removal of the exposed layer
Earth excavation Removal of the layer directly beneath the topsoil
Rock excavation Removal of material that cannot be excavated without
using special excavation methods.
Muck excavation Removal of excessively wet material and soil that is
unsuitable for stockpiling
Unclassified excavation Removal of a combination of the above materials
Purpose of different types of excavations
Cut and fill excavation Material that is cut or stripped.
Trench excavation Trench is an excavation in which the length greatly
exceeds the depth.
Footing Typically used to form strip foundations
Basement excavation Part of a building that is either partially or completely
below ground level.
Road excavation Stripping topsoil, cut and fill.
Bridge excavation Footing and abutments of bridges
Types of excavation support include:
• Timber Support
• Trench Boxes
• Trench Sheets
• Caissons
• Cofferdams
Excavations may become unstable or
collapse due to:
• Vibration from vehicles or machinery.
• Weather conditions and surface
water.
• Loads, such as vehicle, machinery or
building materials, being positioned
close to an edge.
• Failure of support systems.

TRENCHING TECHNIQUES
✓ Always start at the top and work in layers. This technique reduces your cycle and
makes the process easier.
✓ Begin at the edge of the trench.
✓ Ensure your excavator is facing the work area. Avoid digging over the side where
possible.
✓ Always work within the machines digging envelope. By staying within the range, the
activity is more efficient, and you can achieve full bucket loads with each pass.

BACKFILL AND COMPACTION
Backfill and sub-base layers are critical to the overall performance of the reinstatement. The
suitability of excavated materials for backfill must be assessed before they are used.
To ensure the backfill / sub-base materials are compacted correctly they should be laid in
stages.
SAFETY INNOVATION IN FOCUS: MACHINE CONTROL (GPS)
GPS is a technology that uses satellite signals to measure the precise
position and orientation of machines and workers on the site. Trimble
GPS can help you improve your excavation productivity providing
accurate 3D positioning, automatic grade control, and real-time data.
LIFTING WITH EXCAVATORS – ENHANCED TRAINING
Lifting with excavators requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within
the Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this
‘safety critical’ activity, below outlines some key safety information when lifting with
excavators.

How to read a lifting capacity chart:
The chart and descriptions below outline how to read a lifting capacity chart.
Dipper arm length: The machine can be fitted with different length dipper arms, depending
on application of the specific machines. For example, bulk earth moving excavators will have
short dipper arms for speed and power compared to civils machines which have longer
dipper arms for reach and depth. The general rule of thumb is the longer the arm, the less
the machine will lift. If you are unsure of what length arm is fitted to your machine - contact
your nearest depot and state the specific plant number. The same models can vary
dependent on the dipper length number.
Reach: The reach is found across the top of the lift capacity chart in this example, when
positioning the machine to carry out any lifting you must ensure a full lift plan is in place and
adhered to unless you are unhappy with its contents, never exceed the reach for each
weight lifted as this could compromise stability.
Height/depth: In this example, the height and depth is found down the left hand side.
Always ensure no personnel are in the vicinity and you have full visibility when lifting or
lowering loads. 0m is ground level and anything above 0m is in the air; anything below 0m is
in the ground.
Weight/SWL: The weight is in KG, SWL stands for safe working load and this must never be
exceeded past what the manufactures state in there lifting capacity diagram charts. If there
is no value stated in the chart the machine is not capable of lifting to that configuration.
Machine configuration: In line with the tracks or over the end is where the machine are
more stable, with the length of the track frame providing a large footprint. Over the side or
lifting cross carriage will greatly reduce the amount the machine can lift as the track frame is
narrow compared to the length.

When calculating the gross weight of a load to be lifted, always consider the weight of the
quick hitch, lifting accessories, load, and any packaging (e.g. pallets/straps).
Information and the Pre-Use Checks must be carried out by the operator before loading
operations commence.
To allow Object Handling / Lifting Operations to be carried out using an Excavator the
machine must be equipped with the following capabilities:
Machine max lift capacity Less than 1 Tonne:
i. Load chart
ii. Lifting eye
Machine max lift capacity greater than 1 Tonne:
i. Load chart
ii. Lifting eye
iii. Overload warning device
iv. Check values
v. RCI (Rate Capacity Indicator) – where stipulated by the lift plan and RAMS)
The following general pre-use checks must be carried out (machines may vary) before
loading operations can commence:
ii. iii. i. Select Lifting Mode.
Ensure the RCI is switched on.
Check RCI is working correctly (As per manufactures instructions).
• Ensure there is a lift plan or method statement in place before carrying out a lifting
operation.
• Ensure that the hydraulics are disengaged before the slinger can approach the
excavator and connect or disconnect the slung load.
• Ensure you communicate with the slinger/signaller to clarify signals to be used.
• Ensure that the hydraulics are disengaged before the slinger approaches the
excavator and connects or disconnects the slung load. Ensure all lifts are fully
controlled with smooth operations.
• Should the overload warning alarm sound then STOP, reduce the load radius and
when safe to do so lower to the ground the load.
• Ensure ground is level and firm.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MACHINE USE
The main types of pollution associated with construction
operations are:
• Air pollution
• Water pollution
• Noise pollution
There are various pollution prevention strategies that can be
used. Operators can minimise their effect on the
environment by using the machine efficiently:
• Lower engine speeds where possible.
• Ensure there is no spillage of fluids.
• Keep the machine well maintained.
• Ensure prior planning of the work task.
Ask your tutor for a copy of the Flannery Fuel Saver Handbook. The guide provides essential
knowledge and know-how about the operation for saving fuel or better fuel efficiency.
